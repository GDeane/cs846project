## 1. Evaluation Criteria

This section defines how students can determine whether they solved the example problems correctly.

Criteria vary depending on the specific problem. Each problem's evaluation criteria are detailed in Section 2.

There are many possible criteria for evaluating requirements as good or bad.

In this problem, we will evaluate individual requirements based on the 7 requirement quality attributes previously
presented by Denger et al. [2] and Genova et al. [3], and applied in the study by Ronaki et al. (2023) [1]. These
quality attributes include:

- Abstraction
- Atomicity
- Consistency
- Correctness
- Unambiguity
- Understandability
- Feasibility

For each quality attribute, a brief description, good example, and bad example are given.

#### 1. Evaluation Criteria

1. Abstraction

**Description:**  
"The requirements tell what the application must do without telling how it must
do it, i.e. excess of technical detail about the implementation must be avoided in the
specification of the requirements" [3].

**Good Example:**
"The system shall allow the user to ask whether a proposed meeting time fits their schedule, considering existing events
and expected travel time."

**Bad Example:**
"The system shall call the Google Calendar API every 60 seconds, store events in a PostgreSQL table called events,
compute travel time using OSRM with the car.lua profile, and cache results in Redis."

---

2. Atomicity

**Description:**  
"Each requirement is clearly determined and identified, without mixing it with
other requirements" [3]. No usage of "and".

**Good Example:**
"The system shall state in its reasoning the estimated travel time between two consecutive events."

**Bad Example:**
"The system shall display the estimated travel time between two consecutive events and automatically suggest a new
meeting time and notify all attendees."

---

3. Consistency

**Description:**  
"There are no contradictions among requirements" [3]. That is, you must not have two mutually exclusive requirements.

**Good Example:**
"The system shall store the user’s calendar data only on the user’s device."

"The system shall perform travel-time calculations locally on the user’s device."

**Bad Example:**
"The system shall store the user’s full calendar history indefinitely to improve recommendations over time."

"The system shall delete all user calendar data immediately after each query."
(Contradiction here)

---

4. Correctness

**Description:**  
"The requirements that are implemented have to reflect the expected (intended) behavior of the users and customers.
That is, everything stated as a requirement is something that shall be met by the final system to fulfill a certain
purpose (suitability). " [2].

**Good Example:**
"The system shall warn the user when the estimated travel time between two events makes it impossible to arrive by the
start time of the later event."

**Bad Example:**
"The system shall display the current stock price of Apple on the calendar screen."
(Doesn't reflect the user's intended purposes of scheduling + travel feasibility + privacy)

---

5. Unambiguity

**Description:**  
"The requirements should only have one possible interpretation. Note that one requirement might be unambiguous to a
certain group of stakeholder but has a different meaning in another. It is important to involve all stakeholders in the
requirements engineering process to gain a common understanding" [2].

"There exists only one interpretation for each requirement" [3].

**Good Example:**
"When the user asks whether a proposed meeting fits, the system shall respond with one of: 'Fits', 'Does not fit', or
'Fits only if the previous meeting ends by [time]', and shall include the computed travel time in minutes."

**Bad Example:**
"The system should usually try to avoid booking meetings when travel would be tight."
(The words "Usually", "try", and "tight" are all open to interpretation.)

---

6. Understandability

**Description:**  
"The requirements are correctly understood without difficulty" [3].

**Good Example:**
"The system shall allow the user to mark a time block as 'Do not schedule meetings'."

**Bad Example:**
"The system shall implement adaptive temporal preference inference with multi-factor context fusion to minimize schedule
intrusion."
(jargon-heavy. Ineffective for communication with stakeholders.)

---

7. Feasibility

**Description:**  
"All requirements can be implemented with the available technology, human resources and budget. Moreover, all
requirements contribute to the monetary success of the system, that is, they are worth to include in the system" [2].

**Good Example:**
"The system shall support travel-time estimates for the user’s selected mode(s) of transportation: walking, driving, and
public transit."

**Bad Example:**
"The system shall predict real-world travel time with 100% accuracy for all cities worldwide, including unexpected
events such as accidents, protests, and weather changes."
(As written, requires fantasy-levels of technology)
