**User:** My billing says I was charged twice for March.
**Bot:** I can help with billing. What's your account email?
**User:** example@company.ca
**Bot:** Thanks. I see one invoice. Did you receive another email?

Later in the same session, user references "the charge from my March subscription" and bot asks for email again 
-> indicates lost context.
