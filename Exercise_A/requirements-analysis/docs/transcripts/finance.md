# Finance Stakeholder Interview Transcript

---

**Interviewer:** Can you summarize Finance's primary concern about the chatbot?  

**Finance:** The model/API spend is becoming material. We need a plan to reduce OpenAI API/token costs — target roughly 40% within 3–6 months.

**Interviewer:** Is the 40% reduction strict?  

**Finance:** It's an executive target. We can accept a phased approach, but show demonstrable progress. One‑time migration spend is allowable if it pays back within about 3–6 months.

**Interviewer:** How much one‑time budget is available?  

**Finance:** Ballpark up to $60k for migration, subject to approval on the cost/benefit case and milestones.

**Interviewer:** Are there acceptable tradeoffs on UX or performance?  

**Finance:** Minor, short‑term UX regressions during tests are tolerable, provided there's a remediation plan and no lasting increase in live support headcount.
