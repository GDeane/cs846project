# Engineering Stakeholder Interview Transcript

**Interviewer:** Thank you for taking the time to speak with me today. Can you start by sharing your thoughts on the current chatbot implementation?

**Engineer:** Sure! The current chatbot is functional, but I believe it has significant limitations, especially regarding context retention. Users often have to repeat themselves, which can be frustrating.

**Interviewer:** What specific improvements do you think are necessary?

**Engineer:** First and foremost, we need to enhance the context retention capabilities. The chatbot should remember previous interactions within the same session to provide more coherent responses. Additionally, I think we should consider switching to the Claude API. I believe Anthropic's model offers better performance and understanding compared to our current solution.

**Interviewer:** What advantages do you see in using the Claude API over the current model?

**Engineer:** The Claude API has a more advanced architecture that allows for better contextual understanding and faster response times. It also has features that can help us manage conversation flows more effectively. This could lead to a more satisfying user experience.

**Interviewer:** Are there any concerns you have regarding the implementation of the Claude API?

**Engineer:** Yes, there are a couple of concerns. First, we need to evaluate the cost implications of switching APIs. If the Claude API is significantly more expensive, we might face pushback from the finance team. Additionally, we need to ensure that our existing infrastructure can support the integration of a new API without major overhauls.

**Interviewer:** How do you think we can balance the need for improved performance with cost considerations?

**Engineer:** I think we should conduct a thorough cost-benefit analysis. If we can demonstrate that the improved user experience leads to higher customer satisfaction and retention, it might justify the additional costs. We could also explore optimizing our usage of the API to minimize expenses.

**Interviewer:** What other technical constraints should we be aware of?

**Engineer:** We need to consider the time required for integration and testing. Switching APIs isn't just a plug-and-play situation; we need to ensure that everything works seamlessly. Additionally, we should assess our team's capacity to handle this transition alongside other ongoing projects.

**Interviewer:** Thank you for your insights. Is there anything else you would like to add?

**Engineer:** Just that I believe investing in a better API will pay off in the long run. We need to keep the user experience at the forefront of our decisions, even if it means navigating some initial challenges.
