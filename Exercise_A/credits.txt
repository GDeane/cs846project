Transcripts were written by me (Artemiy) and fleshed out by Copilot gpt 5 mini to make them sound more like an interview using prompt "Modify this transcript outline to make it sound like a real interview. Do not add any new ideas or dialogue to it."

Bad examples were generated using the same model with poorly crafted prompts and modified to showcase and exacerbate aspects of a bad solution.
