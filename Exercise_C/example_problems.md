## 1. Example Problems

### Problem C_1: Functional vs Non-Functional Requirement Classification with AI Awareness

**Task Description:**  
You are working as a requirements engineer on an Online Healthcare Appointment System.
The system allows patients to book appointments, receive reminders, and manage medical data.

An AI assistant (e.g., GitHub Copilot Chat or ChatGPT) is available to assist with requirements engineering tasks;
however, human judgment is still required.

You are given the following requirements:

- R1. The system shall allow patients to book appointments online.
- R2. The system shall encrypt all patient data stored in the database.
- R3. The system shall send appointment reminders via email and SMS.
- R4. The system shall respond to user requests within 2 seconds.
- R5. The system shall comply with healthcare data privacy regulations.
- R6. The system shall provide a user-friendly interface for elderly patients.

**Student Tasks:**

1. Classify each requirement as either Functional Requirement (FR) or Non-Functional Requirement (NFR) and provide a
   brief justification for each classification.
2. Human Oversight Reflection - explain why AI-assisted requirement classification should always include human review.

### Problem C_2: Requirements Satisfiability Reasoning

**Task Description:**  
You are evaluating whether a system design satisfies a stated security requirement for an Online Healthcare System.

Your task is to determine if the current design meets the requirement and to reason about potential improvements.

An AI assistant may be used to support analysis; however, human judgment is required.

Requirement:
“The system shall ensure that only authorized users can access patient records.”

Design Description:

- Users log in with a username and password.
- No multi-factor authentication is used.

**_Student Tasks:_**

1. Satisfiability Decision - Does the given design satisfy the requirement? Answer Yes or No.

2. Reasoning - Explain your decision in 2–3 sentences.

3. Design Improvement - Suggest one design change that would improve the satisfiability of the requirement.

### Problem C_3: Requirements Elicitation Question Generation with AI Assistance

**Task Description:**
You are supporting early-stage requirements elicitation for a Smart Parking System.

The system is intended to help drivers find available parking spaces and help city administrators manage parking
resources.

An AI assistant (e.g., GitHub Copilot Chat or ChatGPT) can be used to help generate requirements elicitation questions.
However, the usefulness of the questions depends on prompt clarity and human review.

**_Student Tasks:_**

1. Survey Question Design - Write three survey questions intended to be answered by general users (drivers) of the smart
   parking system.

2. Interview Question Design - Write three interview questions intended to be answered by a city transportation
   administrator.

3. Question Quality Review - Identify one weakness in the generated questions (e.g., ambiguity, lack of scope, missing
   non-functional aspects).

4. Question Improvement - Rewrite one question to improve its clarity or specificity.
